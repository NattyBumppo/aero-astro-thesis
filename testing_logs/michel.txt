Michel's testing log
==================================

moving forward 3000 rpm
initially reviewed pilot screen
distance traveled
observed slope starts flat
actually looked at correlation screen, yay
observed packet correlation
looked at different high correlation values
misunderstood channel name (cpu rotations)
didn't know how to respond to fault info
unclear if he needs to click?
observed going downslope

had to re-read alert panel row description

guessed we'd entered shadow

signal strength low--entered valley guessed

didn't really pay attention to the connectivity map

observed negative correlation between mission time and battery level

tried to click alert panels on correlation screen

observed when we got out of the crater

concluded when we got up into the sun

misunderstood more channel names... we really ought to make hovertext, I think

noticed unstable terrain! yay!

had problems clicking touchpad

would be nice for the alert panels on the correlation screen to send you back to the pilot/copilot screens and fault information

some information about organization would be nice--pdu correlations, mc correlations, etc.

sampling "level" to sampling "window"

====================
Main points
====================

-Channel names are occasionally hard to understand
-Touchpad sucked (well, yeah)
-Better correlation map organization (or, well, obvious organization) would be better
