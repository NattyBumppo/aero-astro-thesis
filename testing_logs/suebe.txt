Suebe-kun's testing log
==================================

looking at correlation table first
looking at high positive correlations first
trying to use positive correlations to get an idea of what's happening

wasting a lot of time on the correlation screen (if you ask me...)

trying to click alert buttons on screen

noticed alert panels immediately

didn't understand a lot of the English

noticed temperature going down

going back to correlation screen

noted that the radio isn't working properly

noted the attitude faults

using the substring search to look for radio correlations--suspecting some sort of radio fault

* maybe good to make a HL relative altitude indicator...?

"radio is broken? not receiving packets?"

just noticed pitch going up

still trying to figure out radio instability

noticed difference in temperature (much lower than before)

battery is lowering too... thinks this probably means we're not charging properly

using battery correlations to tell about the battery behavior

noticed the vboost going up

spending a good amount of time on each screen

noticed the temperature going up as well

* hit the corr map pause bug too

looking at temp correlations and determining that it's going up across the board from that

noticed the attitude leveling out
sort of figuring out what had happened
realized this means the radio issues might have to do with the temperature or the attitude

wheel has locked, but hasn't noticed yet

realized charge is fixed

just noticed wheel trouble
looking at correlation for wheel

* updating value in paused mode... might be floating point error...??

using correlation map to look for correlations that happened right around the wheel lock time

some way or removing unwanted information on analysis screen... better ways to narrow down information

arrows were very helpful

helped him remember what the previous values were



====================
Main points
====================

-Correlation map, even when you understand what's going on, is not good for live telemetry analysis
-Arrows were very helpful
-Too much focus on specific data analysis can create tunnel vision with respect to critical fault events
-We need a way to skip from any screen to the detailed fault information
-Screen transition lag is a bit of an issue
