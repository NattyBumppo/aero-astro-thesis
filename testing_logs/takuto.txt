Takuto's testing log
==================================

rover's moving
everything is "clear"
3000 RPM
monitoring voltage as being okay
continuing to monitor distance traveled
noticed flat environment
seems very comfortable with the data
noticed that it hasn't stopped

looking at correlation map... doesn't know how to use it "I guess this is fine"

noticed pitch slope

noticed charge voltage going down immediately

understood solar panels not getting charge immediately

thought about possibility of stuck mode, but saw rover is still moving, so is happy about movement

noticed temperature drop--even remembered the drop amount "10 degrees drop"

not really using the alert panel fault information

noticing "connectivity starting to haywire"

rover's starting going uphill now... will he notice? (noticed about a minute later)

doesn't seem to notice the channel substring search option

interpreted pitch angle as "climbing up the hill"

not sure if IMU is working correctly--bad connectivity made him doubt things

using the fault information a little bit

thinks rover isn't functioning correctly because of lower temps and low battery

"a little bit worried"

"the data does not make sense"

noticed solar power being back on

"I find it funny that total distance is not correlated with amount of current and amount of voltage with the motor"

attitude is getting rocky... will he notice? (didn't seem to notice)

immediately noticed motor issue

not using fault infomration... will he find it? (he didn't use it)

now reviewing data

scrubbing back and forth

looking at analysis correlation
trying to figure out what the problem is
"there's a lot of data sets"

Accidental correlations seem a bit too distracting...

understood downhill -> shade -> solar power input

since solar power came back, it makes sense that it didn't actually "die;" we were in the shade

"a small ditch"

a little worried about battery temps

pcb temperature... a little confusing for people who haven't worked on it as to where it's located
doesn't know what the conv1-2-3 are
it might be better to distinguish what the data items mean
clarify their meanings better or change their names

not sure how to look at the analysis data
a small tutorial would be nice


* Bug: looks like values are still updating on the correlation map corr. value display, even when the visualization is supposed to be paused!!

missed flat at the bottom of the crater and rough terrain

====================
Main points
====================

-correlation map is hard to understand and has too much data
-unclear what certain data items mean
