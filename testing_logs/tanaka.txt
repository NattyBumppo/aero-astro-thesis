Tanaka-san's testing log
==================================
-Wondered about the meanings of some of the parameters
-Had trouble finding speed; would like if there was a clearer indicator of speed
-Stayed on the copilot screen for most of the time
-Used the fault info well

-Didn't notice temperature changes at first, but saw them on later data review
-Liked to pause and review data, but didn't do so for too long
-Thought the correlation map wasn't easy to view during real-time runs, but seemed useful for after-the-fact data review
-(That said, he didn't hardly use it at all :-p )
-Though the indicator arrows were easy to understand and useful
-A graph of values would be a nice addition--to be able to select a value and actually see how it changed with time
-Fault changes and error information are very easy to understand

-Gave a good summary of what happened, except didn't comment on terrain roughness (I emphasized it more for later runs, because it was really too subtle)

====================
Main points
====================

-Parameter meaning not all clear
-Better speed indicator might be better
