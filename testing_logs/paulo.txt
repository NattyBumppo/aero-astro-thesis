Paulo's testing log
==================================

not 100% sure that he understood all of my explanation

first looking at motor voltage

understands rover is moving straight ahead from rotations

spent a minute or so examining the pilot screen

"everything seems fine until now"

noticed something weird about the right motor (?)

noticed that it's going down

"the voltage is too high" (misunderstood the meaning of the alert panel)

reading the fault info literally, but doesn't seem to interpret its meaning very well

"maybe we're entering some sort of cave, I don't know, because the soloar panels still don't have enough energy"

Spending most of his time on the pilot screen

might not understand the connectivity map 
"the components are flashing; sounds dangerous"
"I would do an emergency stop if I was a pilot"

"the radio is not responding"

"no line of sight... so probably there's some sort of cliff"

doesn't seem to understand the correlation map

inferred that we're in the shade: "the cliff is blocking the sun"

didn't seem to notice that the rover is going uphill, or that it bottomed out earlier

noticing the low battery and that we don't have solar energy

noticed the charging getting better "okay, we are seeing the sun again"

"it's charging... too fast, this is strange" (that's true...)

noticed time mismatch

noticed the rover attitude getting choppy: "we almost flip... we're facing some harsh environment... probably passing through some rocks and obstacles"

* need to cut RPM to 0 after lock, oops... I'll fix after this :op


Didn't look at the correlation map because he wasn't sure how to use it... because he doesn't know channel names and meanings

using the data scrubbing to good advantage

came up with a good representation of what happened

really likes the rover info on the Pilot screen... likes the large icons

didn't use analysis--didn't know how to use it


would like to have graphs

====================
Main points
====================

-Correlation map requires training to understand properly
-Changes may need to be more visible, as they're missed occasionally
-Sometimes non-serious faults (rocky terrain) can be interpreted as serious ("we almost flipped")
-Data scrubbing back and forth is very useful
-Graphs would be useful
