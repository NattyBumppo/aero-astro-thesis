Mickael's testing log
==================================

looking at orange arrows doesn't understand what they mean
understands rover is going forward
no problems yet
understood the grey modules on the conn. map as meaning "offline"

looking at the corr. map... finds it "disturbing"
thought it was a loading screen at the beginning

hasn't commented on the distance and RPM, but seems to understand that the rover is moving forward
explained that this is coming from distance and RPM and rotations

noticed downhill

took about five seconds to notice the fault indications (longer than others)

hung up on transition lag
not worried about pitch

trying to figure out why the solar cells are having problems
looking at correlation map but is having trouble

would like to see channels linked to faulted ones on correlation map (good idea!)

wants to use correlation window better but hard to use

hasn't noticed yet that rover is going uphill
hasn't noticed the temperature changing

started to figure out the ditch thing... gave a hypothesis that it's in a ditch

"a lot of orange" (too many positive correlations to figure out what things mean)

not noticing the other elements for narrowing down/manipulating data on corr map

tried to click alert panel on corr map

as soon as rover got up a bit, he figured out what had happened

commented out how he wishes there was camera data to inform the decisions

proposed stopping rover in bottom of ditch, but later figured out that that would have been a problem

trying his hardest to use the correlation map, but having problems with it

noticed the rocky terrain as soon as it started (noticed based on attitude alerts while on the corr map screen)

reiterating his summary of what happened

without camera and tof data, it's a bit hard to understand the rover state

needs proper training
really likes the copilot window

needs more explanations on how to find stuff
thought it was a loading screen at first

theorized about regolith in the joints or rocky situation

thinking about how to correct rocky

easy to understand that it was in a ditch when it started going back up

flashing lights can be overwhelming

didn't use data review / playback features

feature idea: or highlighted faulted channels on the correlation map

====================
Main points
====================

-Correlation map is hard to understand
-Highlighting channels of interest in the correlation map (like faulted ones) would be useful
