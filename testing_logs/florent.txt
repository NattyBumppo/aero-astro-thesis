Florent's testing log
==================================

advancing, not changing
everything normal
noticed distance increasing
spending equal time on each screen, so far
* tried to click on title to change screens (not a bad idea...)
still advancing
noticed pitch/roll flatness

noticed pitch down
immediately deduced we'd gone into a "cave"

used the correlation substring search!
looked at voltage correlations

noticed connectivity map drops


kept screen paused and didn't realize it was paused

understood connectivity map intuitively
"lost some packets"

kind of difficult to see patterns in the correlation map
"difficult to... pinpoint what we want to see"

looking for failed packets in correlation map
found correlation between charge, but that's not really a good correlation

noticed us climbing out

*p in the text area on the analysis panel pauses! Oops! Need to fix that...

noticed the battery beginning to charge again
deduced that we'd gotten outside of a cave again

noticed the temperature having gone down

tried to use correlation map but couldn't figure out the right channel names to search

saw the rough terrain as "an area with a slope but it's on the side"

saw the stuck wheel notice immediately

icon rotations for pitch/roll are useful

eventually figured out that the terrain at the end was rocky, not just a slope to the side, from the amount of variation



generally, the copilot interface is pretty clear
not sure about the meaning of some of the data items, like the PDU

the Abalysis interface: showing the correlation is interesting
you need to know what you want to pountpoint before going to this screen
there's a lot of information in a lot of little squares
some correlations are obvious
if you want to search for correlations, this is interesting...

not super-useful for random exploration, I think he's saying... you need to know what you want to see

pilot screen is great for general information, but when we can't send information, the copilot interface is more interesting

and the copilot has all of the pilot's info too, so their screen is more useful

but the pilot is good for controlling the rover

====================
Main points
====================

-Easy to not realize that you're paused
-Hard to know what correlations to search for
-Copilot screen is extremely useful for monitoring telemetry
