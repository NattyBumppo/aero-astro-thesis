\chapter{Visualization of Correlative Relationships}

Purpose:

-talk about why we need to visualize correlative relationships in the first place
-talk about challenges of visualization of correlation
-talk about Z-scores for comparison and other traditional statistical methods
-present corrgrams and their background and theory
-talk about some popular applications of corrgrams and research
-talk about extensions and the idea of animated corrgrams
--don't get into the widgets/data reduction methods of corrgrams yet; I can do that later


\section{Goals}



We borrowed insight and several visualization techniques from the literature. Cancro et al. developed useful techniques for packing large numbers of channels into a dense rectangular space \cite{Cancro}, and Yairi et al. demonstrated ways to show change correlation between data channels \cite{Yairi}, which were inspirations for our Global Correlation Matrix and Channel Correlation Vector.
