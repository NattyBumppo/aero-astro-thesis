Yeah, that's basically how living things do it. What gets output into consciousness isn't a data set so much as a gestalt evaluation of what it *means, * in relation to other movement and to goals, to be moving in such a way. Whether the notion that both evolutionary and cognitive search algorithms converge on a similar shorthand means anything in terms of larger information-theoretic gameplay, I couldn't begin to guess.
